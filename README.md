# Project 1: chemical-recycling-using-ML
This is the first of multiple projects I'll be working on. My goal is to combine chemical engineering and data science to increase and hone my skills.
I will first create a chemical recycling machine learning model. I'll be updating this along the way.

Creating a chemical recycling machine learning model serves as a powerful tool to address the pressing challenges in sustainability and environmental conservation. Let's delve deeper into how these two areas intertwine:

Environmental Impact of Chemical Engineering:
Chemical engineering plays a significant role in various industries, including manufacturing, energy production, and pharmaceuticals. However, these processes often result in the generation of chemical waste that can have detrimental effects on the environment. Chemical engineers strive to minimize these impacts through waste management strategies, but challenges still remain in identifying the recyclability of chemical substances.

The Need for Chemical Recycling:
Chemical recycling offers a promising solution to tackle the environmental concerns associated with chemical waste. By transforming waste chemicals into valuable resources, it reduces reliance on raw materials, minimizes pollution, and promotes a circular economy. However, determining the recyclability of diverse chemical substances is a complex task that requires extensive analysis and expertise.

Integration of Machine Learning:
Machine learning, a field within data science, empowers us to derive insights and make predictions from vast and complex datasets. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze patterns, identify key features, and develop models that accurately predict the recyclability of chemical substances. This integration enables us to automate and enhance the decision-making process, making chemical recycling more effective and efficient.

Advantages of a Chemical Recycling Machine Learning Model:
By creating a chemical recycling machine learning model, we can achieve several key benefits:

Predictive Power: The model can predict the recyclability of chemical substances with a high degree of accuracy, allowing us to make informed decisions regarding their treatment and reuse.
Efficiency and Scalability: Machine learning models can process large quantities of data quickly, enabling rapid analysis of chemical samples and facilitating the scaling of recycling processes.
Insights for Process Optimization: Analyzing the model's output and feature importance can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing recyclability. This information can guide improvements in chemical design, waste management, and recycling techniques, leading to enhanced sustainability.
By combining the principles of chemical engineering with the capabilities of machine learning, we can unlock new opportunities to revolutionize chemical recycling practices. This integration empowers us to make substantial progress towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.
